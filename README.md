# Clavibacter michiganensis inoculation method
This document describes and allows to run the analysis conducted in the article "Diet and injection, our recommendation to characterize Clavibacter michiganensis- tomato interactions" from Brochu et al.Â 2023. In this study, we considered the protocols employed by various research groups and compared two of the most popular inoculation methods to identify the most efficient. In addition, we investigated how the level of fertilization could contribute to better characterize the physiological response of tomato plants to Clavibacter michiganensis infection. We used the percentage of necrotic leaves and the plant height to compare the different inoculation methods and fertilization levels.
